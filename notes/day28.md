# Day 28 Practice: Shell Scripting Basics

Focus: Introduction to Bash scripting, automating commands and understanding shell execution.

## What I Learned:
-The purpose of shell scripts and how Bash interprets commands line by line.
-Creating and running scripts with chmod +x and ./filename.sh.
-Using variables, user input, and command substitution.
-Documenting scripts using # for comments.
-Organizing scripts neatly inside notes/scripts for better project structure.

## Practice Summary:
-hello.sh — printed a welcome message using echo.
-variables.sh — demonstrated how to store and display variables.
-input.sh — practiced reading user input with read.
-sysinfo.sh — displayed system information dynamically using commands like date, hostname, and uptime.
-sysinfo_doc.sh — added detailed comments and structure to document every part of a script.
